								<h1>Motion Capture Week 3</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								So for this week of motion capture I had to setup my scene with some new lights and materials
								<p></p>

								<a href="images/unlit.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/unlit.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>
							
								I decided to continue forward with the environment I had from the first week and start with an unlit room there.
								
								<a href="images/game.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/game.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>
							
								I figured that this room could use some lights so I added two ceiling lamps and put them in pactical spots. I added a point
								light to create a nice shine on the floor but it didn't quite fill the room with warm light like I wanted so I also threw in a 
								point light in their locations. I balanced the intensity and set the color temperature to warm. 

								<a href="images/warm.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/warm.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								it got a little too warm so I decided to try out the rectangle lights which I hadn't tried before. I was thinking there would be some 
								blue day light coming in so I placed a rectangle light in each window oriented and sized accordingly. I then adjusted the intensity, 
								shadows, and temperature to a cool blue.
							
								<a href="images/cold.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/cold.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>
								
								together I thought it came out pretty nice! 

								<a href="images/merged.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/merged.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>
							
								The environment I had was already well textured and lighting didn't take too long so I decided to start working on the custom android
								character I was imaginging to use later down the road.

								<p></p>
								<a href="images/kit1.jpg" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/kit1.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								<p></p>
								It's still a work in progress but with so little time these days, I decided to go with a kitbash workflow. 

								<a href="images/kit2.JPG" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/kit2.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								The pre-made hard-surface pieces I bought were from an artist named Vitaly Bulgarov from his website. In Maya I had to place 
								the parts together to start composing the character.
								

								<a href="images/mat1.JPG target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/mat1.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								I decided to start making some master materials before importing my character, one for when I have textures to add 
								and one with just basic solid materials.
						
								<a href="images/mat2.JPG" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/mat2.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								From work experience, I learned about this workflow of master materials, it makes it so that you can slot in parameters
								so that you can make an instance that would accept textures or values so that you could 
								interactivly edit the attributes without having to save and wait for the changes to save.

								<a href="images/mat3.JPG" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/mat3.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								This also helps speed things up when you have dozens of textures to bring in since you can just slot them into instances
								without having to make a bunch of new materials and connect a bunch of pipes. I think it also makes the stuff run faster 
								in engine. I also will have my black and white textures like roughness and metallic merged later on in the RGB channels for
								more optimizating. 

								<a href="images/robo1.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/robo1.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>
								I decided to try the character out in the environment and new lighting I set up to feel things out. 

								<a href="images/robo2.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/robo2.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								Put on some placeholder solid materials that look like metal and started feel out how my character would look.

								<a href="images/robo3.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/robo3.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span></a>

								So far so good I think. Still have a lot to do on her but pretty happy with how it's coming along so far!
