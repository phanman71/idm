								For getting my arduino to talk with p5JS, I followed the steps and got it working with my old space invaders game
								from a few weeks ago. It was pretty tricky to get used to closing the connection before uploading the next set of code
								but I eventually got used to it. I decided to keep the lights too since I thought they were pretty fun.

								I started off by testing my second button with the example code and decided to have the shape change fill color. Once I 
								knew that would work, I copied over my code and replaced the keystrokes with the physical button presses. I considered adding
								a 3rd button for shooting but the controller was already cramped so I decided to just have the ship shoot when you move. Overall
								I'm pretty glad that I'm starting to get the hang of these electronic things.
