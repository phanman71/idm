								<h1>Motion Capture Week 5</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								For this week of motion capture, I went ahead and finished my prototype for the facial motion capture helm! It took a lot of trial and error but in the end I think it came out pretty well.
								I also ran out of black filament but had some orange laying around so I figured why not since it's almost Halloween haha.

							It still has a lot of room for improvement but for now I think it should work. After I got the airsoft helmet on amazon, I printed out the attachments for the arc rails which slid in pretty nicely the first try. 	
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat2.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							I then made the arms which can be adjusted with knobs that tighten since I added screws and nuts into them. 
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat3.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							The phone holder was a little tricky to get perfect but it workx pretty well, it uses hair bands to hold the two parts together.
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat4.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							After trying it on, the whole setup was pretty heavy due to the torque of the phone being so far from the face. I figured a second strap setup would work to hold the back down and wrap around the chin.
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat5.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							I printed more rails that use the lower arc rails and stole a backpack clip from the backpack that IDK gave me to make it adjustable. 
							This sorta works but it isn't quite as comfortable as I imaged. Maybe I can make some sort of chin strap in the future.
						
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat6.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							I watched a little bit of the Epic games video on youtube to see how to setup the iphone
							with UE4. I sent in a developer request for the AR kit software but haven't heard back yet.
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hat7.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							I also heard that it helps to have nice lighting so I also bought an LED strip and some electric tape to add that on. 


							I'm hopeing I'll be able to get this all setup and get a nice facial motion capture setup going with a custom 3D head for later in the semester.

							For the Radical software test, I found a video of Terry Crews doing the robot. He does it pretty well. 

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/terry2.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
									
							But the auto smoothing completely ruined the robot feel which is kinda hilarious. I guess that's one thing Radical can't do!
