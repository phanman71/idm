								<h1>Week 2: Self Presentation: Avatar Creation </h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>

								For my custom avatar, I decided to make a cartoon version of myself riding in a floating mecha head. I find that I often represent myself similar to my real life looks, I don't think it's from narcissism or pride but maybe that I feel more connected if I am represented closer to reality. 
								<p></p>
								I found the character model that I modified from Mixamo but I chose this stylization choice not only because it would run more smoothly since it works as a lower poly model but also for viewers to fill in the blanks. With cartoons, they appeal a lot more for most people because of the simplicity and how the mind can fill in the details while more realistic models would fall into the uncanny valley. 
								<p></p>
								I thought it would be fun to have my little guy float around in a giant mecha head. The design is based on one of my favorite anime, Gurren Lagann. Besides showing off my interest in Japanese cartoons and mechas I thought it would work great in Mozilla hubs since most avatars don't quite have legs that animate for walking.
