								<h1>3D Art & Aesthetics Week 7 Midterm, Breakfast of Champions</h1>

								<p></p>

								<center>
								For my midterm I went ahead and did the final push to get everything together. For my hero object, I kinda always wanted to try making food in 3D but never had the chance so why not now for an extra level of dirtiness. I went with a taylor ham pork roll egg and cheese breakfast sandwich since I'm from NJ. After getting some basic shapes, doing a fun little cloth sim on my cheese and mainly focusing on good edgeflow and proportions, I exported it out into zbrush. 

								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/01_sandwich.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								In zbrush I used some radial symmetry for the bread pattern and added some noise detail to everything, trying to work quick since my time was limited. I also had to pose the sandwich and form things around a little bit. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/02_sandwich.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								Exporting a lower subdivion level out for the render, I did some quick UVing and made sure the models where all nice and clean. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/03_sandwich.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I sent it out into my prefered baker which was marmoset toolbag where I baked some normal maps with the higher polyverions as well as any other maps I needed. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/04_sandwich.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I then put it together in substance painter and applied the baked maps.

								After some texture painting and a little procedural stuff, I think it came out pretty nice. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/06_sandwich.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								For the pedestal, I quickly modeled a nice toliet I found a picture of online, threw on a cloth sim on the table cloth, and also made a simple plate.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/07_dirty.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								After I decided on my final camera composition, I hid all the extra stuff that was out of camera view so I didn't waste any time making for anything that I didn't need to. For the lighting I decided to go for a very early morning look since it's breakfast time. With some cool blues for the sky, a light warm color for the sun, and a few warm overhead street lamps, I think it came out okay. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/08_dirty.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I did the standard render passes, luckily the computer I got from work is pretty powerful, I think it took about 20-30 mins after setting it to 4k, raising some of the sample rates of the lights, and raising the camera AA. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/09_dirty.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								After compositing the layers together and adjusting it a bunch I added some other things to try and bump it up a bit. Luckily the project is just a single render so I just did some photoshoping to get some dirt texture on it. I really didn't feel like uving and texturing all those props. In the end, I think I'm pretty happy with my result, and will probably put it in my portfolio.
