								<h1>Creative Coding Week 7</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								 Here's the mid term!
							
								<p></p>

								<p></p>
									For my mid term, last week I got the 3D ship, crosshairs, and rotation controlls all working. I also made a 
									basic structure for a start menu that included music. This week I put the two projects together as well as organize 
									all the objects into seperate .js files. 
									<p></p>
									So the idea is that the enemies spawn based on how fast the music is, so for each song, it increase the difficulty. 
									I also added a counter to count the number of enemies hit as well as for every time you get hit. I figured it would 
									be more enjoyable to play through a whole song and see how far you could get by the end without getting hit too much 
									or how many you could avoid before geting the target score. I'm not completely sure if the enemies spawn according to 
									the music since it's a little chaotic but I think it's close. 
									<p></p>
									I also tried using splice to delete bullets and enemies that go off screen, which I think works. From the space 
									invaders demo I made a few weeks ago, I used the collision function from that. I also put in a sound effect to play every
									time you shot but that got really annoying so I decided to remove it but did add a fun sound effect if you won. 
									<p></p>
									Testing this out on my laptop, I've realized that making the game on my ultrawide monitor might not
									have been the best place. I tried pulling in my cool rotating dance party from a few weeks ago too but 
									that kinda got a little too crazy so I ommited it. The exploding particles didn't quite work out either.
								
									<p></p>
									The one thing I wished worked out better is the collision, right now it's not quite accurate 
									and I'm not quite sure why the score goes up when you get hit too. 
									I did a little research and I think to make it feel good, you have to use shader detection or something or 
									some crazy vector math. Even though it's not quite perfect I think I'm happy with what I got, 
									after all the hours I put in, if anything its a pretty cool audio and visual experience.
