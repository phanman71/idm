								<h1>AR Week 3 GPS</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								So for my GPS AR project this week, I came up with a narrative that fit my environment. I live within walking distance to my town's downtown so I thought about what I usually do there, which is get coffee or food. I came up with a story about myself feeling down and tired, starting outside my apartment I started my journey. 
								<p></p>
								I did a video timelapse to show myself walking to each destination, I actually had to speed it up to 3000 percent at some points to make it feel less boring. Another thing I added was the map overlay to help make it feel less tedious. For the first destination I actually forgot to screen record so I had to come back the next day and record the few seconds in the snowstorm. Before the second location, my phone actually died so I also had to run back to my apartment to charge my phone and grab a battery pack. 
								<p></p>
								I don't know how good my acting was but I wanted to show that what I really needed was some tasty food. I actually decided on the music later on during the editing stage which ended up fitting pretty well I think.
