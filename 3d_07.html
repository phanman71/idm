								<h1>3D Art & Aesthetics Final</h1>

								<p></p>

								For my final, I decided to do the NYU R-Lab over at the Brookyln Navy Yard. The project required an indoor space that had a window so I wanted to pick a space that had some cool looking forms. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/pic1.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								What makes this space pretty cool is that there are these weird lights and other design things like the sound panel hexagons. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/pic2.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I also like all the modern furniture in the industrial space since it really does feel like a tech startup. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/pic3.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								The thing about the R-lab is that there's so much space but its usually pretty empty since it's pretty new and the pandemic has sort of slowed it's progress. So I figured it'd be the perfect canvas to fill with some story and life. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/pic4.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								To start out I white boxed the space to try to get my proportions and feel for the space out correctly. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip01.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								After I did that, I started replacing the shapes with some assets I had in UE4 as well as some other assets I could find online since I didn't have too much time to make too many custom objects. I also grabbed a couple materials from quixel bridge as well. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip02.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I then found a nice camera angle and started working on the lighting. I set my scene up with a really wide angle lense setting of about 18mm and threw in a sky light. 
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip04.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								To try to get the lighting correct, I imagined how the lab would look while the lights were off during a late afternoon and closed off all the open walls. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip05.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								I decided to add in some rectangular lights fitted to the windows and kind of faked the look which I thought looked pretty correct. They were set to a high temp so it came off like a cool blue sky. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip06.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								After that I set the ceiling lights up with some mesh lights and adjusted them until they looked pretty close to the picture. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip07.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								Adding a bunch more life into the scene, I tried to really make it look like a tech start up occupied by a bunch of college students. I grabbed a bunch of assets from the planet-real-time show I worked on here as well as a bunch of empty pizza boxes, energy drinks, fun items and more!
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/wip03.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								Overall I was pretty happy with the results, I thin it took me about 16 mins to render out at 1440p and increased sample rate settings. I think it tells the story I was aiming to tell pretty well and got the mood I was going for down.
