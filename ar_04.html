								<h1>AR Week 4 Face Tracking</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								For this week, we learned SparkAR from Facebook. The first one I made was inspired by ghost in the shell, I took a mesh of an anatomy head from zbrush, threw on a chrome shader and set it up to open up when I opened my mouth. Spark has this cool function where it'll take kind of a screen grab of your current face that you can use as a texture, using this, I had it animate off to reveal the robot head. Luckily Spark has some pretty useful node based programming.

								I didn't have to do this second one but just wanted to play around a little bit since it was kind of fun. There's this Magic the Gathering card I saw called peer into the abyss that had some creepy artwork. It inspired me to make this piece, its pretty much the same as the previous one but just amplified to another level. Hope you enjoy it! Below you can see the logic I used to make it work out.
