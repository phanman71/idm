								<h1>Motion Capture Week 4</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								For this week of motion capture, I made a fun little cinematic with a guy exploring the area a bit. I tried to practice some story telling, staging, composition, and timing to hopefully have a video that 
								isn't too awkward or confusing. I've never been too big of a fan of doing animation or camera animation but I think it's pretty important to practice. I'm more of an asset creator usually.

								<p></p>
								I also wanted to start making my facial motion capture rig. First thing I did was get a basic idea based on an exisiting one. I picked the demo used for Hell Blade.

								I was going to go ahead and order a cheap black skateboarding helmet from Amazon and bolt in some holders on the top or sides. But then it dawned on me that I could get a helmet 
								with attachment slots already implimented. I went with a cheap Airsoft helmet that imitates a real soldier's helmet. I don't think this thing will protect you from anything besides 
								plastic pellets, but the arc rails are what's important here.

								Next, I started mocking up some designs in Maya to 3D print or CNC. I'm thinking adjustable knobs on the sides to adjust the height and a solid phone holder for an iPhone in the front. Luckily, I got a bunch of NYU Makerspace training 
								done last week. I think I'll also velcro or zip tie some LEDs to the rails like in the reference as well. Hope this thing comes out okay!
