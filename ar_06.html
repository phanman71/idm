								<h1>AR Week 1</h1>

								When I was an undergrad back at Rochester Institute of Technology study 3D digital design I had a pretty ambitious thesis planned out. The thing was that it took a lot of time, more than I ever spent on a project since I had to learn and figure things out at the same time. 
								<p></p>
								This is when I decided that during my last semester I would not sleep on Wednesdays! To top this off, when there were 10 days left until the final presentation which was on graduation day, I believe I slept an average of about 2-4 hours per night fueled with the help of energy drinks and a jar of peanut butter. The result was myself falling asleep during my graduation ceremony in my chair.

								<p></p>
								So I started out with a really rough storyboard just to get my idea across. I then realized that my 2D drawing 
								abilities had greatly deteriorated. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/storyboard.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								I decided to do the assembly of my project in Unreal Engine, I collected a bunch of free assets from the marketplace 
								and extracted some from other projects. I figured the overall look of the project would look nicer as well as be 
								easier to organize using UE4. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros01.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								Picking through a bunch of the asset packs I collected, I opened up a house level and started plopping in the assets
								I needed to populate my old college bedroom.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros02.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								I went to mixamo and found the closest avatar that looked like me, strangely this one worked out perfectly with the glasses,
								hair, and hoodie choice. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros03.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								I had to do a little bit of tweaking for some of the poses rotating some of the joints in the editor. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros04.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								One of the defining things I remembered was having a nice collection of energy drinks at my desk so I googled for a free 
								model of one and found this beauty. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros05.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								After placing all the objects in a room I modified with new walls, and shorter ceiling and a window, I placed some lights around 
								the scene. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros06.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								I played around with some of the camera angles, used my storyboard for some inspiration and found some nice ones.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros07.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								For the final scene, I brought my avatar into Maya to edit him a bit to get him ready for graduation. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros08.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								I quickly made a hat, extruded a gown out for him, and deleted some of the extra pieces. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/pros09.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  
								Trying to work as effiecently as possible I just made a couple duplicates of my guy and used a close up angle.
