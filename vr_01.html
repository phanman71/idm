								<h1>Week 1: Shaping Pro-Social Interaction in VR </h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>

My biggest insight from this research paper was how environments affect behavior and the things people talk about when socializing in VR. Things like color and shape matter just as much in VR as they do in real life. Things like campfires being inviting and encouraging people to talk more makes a lot of sense to have as a social lubricant. A lot of these ideas of familiar spaces are actually present in the Bobiverse book (the main character is disembodied and creates a VR environment for his sanity) which makes me wonder if the writer studied these ideas or if the concepts are common sense. 
<p></p>
Another thing I found interesting was that emoji expressions seem to matter more than things like hugs and handshakes. The way the researchers discussed how easy (or difficult) such interactions were in the different social VR platforms made me think of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. While the game does have some social features, it’s pretty inconvenient to emote. You only have a limited amount of reactions on your quick access wheel and it’s still a bit clunky to select reactions from that wheel and respond to others quickly enough for it to feel natural. And this is all with a traditional controller to manipulate the interface. Seeing how these systems struggle in regular games does say a lot about how hard it is to make these work smoothly in VR where there might be fewer controls.
<p></p>
Third, I thought it was really valuable from a design perspective to think about how activities and icebreaker activities make a big difference. The idea of roasting marshmallows rather than having a bunch of throwing knives to play with does seem like it’d be better for early interaction with others. The Rec Room idea and having things like laser tag, basketball, and things like that definitely seems like it would get people interacting more easily. These examples make for good mental notes when thinking about how to design a good social VR experience.
<p></p>
One thing I found a bit strange about this paper was how the researchers included some information that didn’t seem completely necessary. For example, when documenting their research protocol, they mentioned using OBS to record interviews. This seemed like an unnecessary detail, but I’m assuming that the researchers just wanted to capture a lot of details for less techy readers.
<p></p>
All in all, this was an interesting intro to the social VR platforms that are currently out there. The whole experience sounds like a crazy sociology or psychology experiment the way some people develop their own codes of conduct,  are attracted to familiar things or dress up like bears to get attention. There are lots of different dynamics to explore in social VR, like with the three different modes. I can definitely see how people interacting with those they know in real life would make for a really different set of design choices than if the social VR environment was either controller or a free for all. Yet in any of those scenarios, making things intuitive for people to jump in and get interacting is a big priority.
