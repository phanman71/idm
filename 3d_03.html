								<h1>3D Art & Aesthetics Week 3/4 putting together scene</h1>

								<p></p>

								<center>
								For my midterm outdoor scene I started gathering assets for it, a lot of them were exported from Unreal Engine scenes I've worked on in the past which saved me a lot of time. I started spending a little bit of time 3D modeling a toliet for fun, I think the little story I'll go with is to make it look like someone is eating some gross food, using the toliet as a table and chair in the middle of the city. I think using some fabric physics should help me make an easy table cloth too, to sell the narative. I've always wanted to 3D model food too since that should be interesting to make materials for. Hopefully texturing and lighting the scene won't take too long, figuring out the camera composition should help me decide which assets to focus on.
