								<h1>Creative Coding Week 10</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>

								For this week of creative coding I learned about analog input/output as well as some things about libraries and some other
								cool gadgets with arduino. I can't say it was super smooth this week since I started having a lot of software and hardware 
								troublshooting that I had to get over but in the end I did get something that sort of worked. 
								<p></p>
								My first plan was to figure out how to have the sensor motors activate the servo motor by touching them, in the end that didn't 
								quite work but I came out with a really complicated looking mess at least.

								What sort of finally came together was when I tried using the RGB LED with the touch sensor, the touch sensor didn't work but when I
								accidentally had some of the resistors touch it turned red...
