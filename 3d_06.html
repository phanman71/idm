								<h1>3D Art & Aesthetics Week Still Life</h1>

								<p></p>

								<center>
								
								For my second project for this class, we had to make take a painting still life and re-create it, trying to get the same sense of lighting and mood. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_01.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								For my piece, I found a painting called Still Life with Oysters, a Silver Tazza, and Glassware by WIllem Claesz Heda, painted in 1635.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_02.png" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								I usually don't really like dealing with grabbing assets from online, cleaning them up, modifying them to fit correctly, and other issues that might pop up but I was pretty tight on time with this one. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_03.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								I made most of models quickly but I eventually went and grabbed a couple things that I could source like the oysters which were a 3D scan that I split up, a lemon and nuts that I grabbed from quixel bridge. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_04.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								Getting the assets to line up correctly and scaled correctly was probably the most time consuming part besides perfecting the lighting. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_05.JPG" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 

								The cloth was made with nCloth, it wasn't perfect and if I had more time, I might have sculpted it in zbrush or made it in marvelous designer.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_06.jpg" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								For the lighting, I mainly used the big glass as reference to try to place them correctly as well as the shine off the backdrop. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images3/still_07.png" style="max-width: 2000px; max-height: 2000px;"alt="" /></span> 
								Overall, I think I was pretty happy with the result. If I spent some more time on it I would like to clean up a bunch of the models and add more details, maybe try out some more custom materials and filters.
