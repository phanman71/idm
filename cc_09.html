								<h1>Creative Coding Week 9</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>

								For this week of creative coding, to make something meaningful with what I've learned, I made an alert LED for when 
								a user uses bad practices at their desk. Carpal tunnel is a pretty bad issue these days as more and more people are 
								spending so much time at their desks. It's not too healthy for people to put a bunch of pressure on their wrists 
								since there are some delicate things going on there. So for good posture with a mouse of keyboard, it's important to
								not lean on your wrists. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/led_01.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								So I started by following the arduino setup sets and setup my bread board with the right setup too, I also tried putting 
								some extra LEDs on it with a parallel setup which seemes to work. The red is a little more powerful than the yellow or 
								green so it might not be as obvious. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/led_02.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								Next I wanted to try out some sort of springy setup for a pad like what was talked about in class. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/led_03.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>

								For that I used a package with bubble wrap built in, and layered it with some cutouts for the aluminum to touch.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/led_04.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								Worked out pretty well, I think I just need some longer wires and some bigger LEDs to really alarm someone, maybe some 
								loud noises to just to really enforce that good posture. 
								 <span class="image main"><img src="images/led_05.gif" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								
								 <span class="image main"><img src="images/led_06.gif" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								I was thinking this would work pretty well for when someone is feel a little sleepy during those long webcam meetings.
