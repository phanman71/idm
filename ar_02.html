								<h1>AR Week 2 Image Based AR</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								For my homework this week, I decided to do an enhanced advertisement. Looking around on google and brainstorming a bunch of topics, I decided to go with food. Most of the ads or posters were pretty plain though which I guess worked out since they would benefit from a fun little experience like AR. I found this ad from Taco Bell which I thought was pretty tasty looking so I decided to play around with it. Thinking outside the bun I figured a way to make it extra appetizing looking by making the cheese pull animate.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images2/ar2_01.jpeg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  

This wasn’t actually too difficult once I was able to isolate the parts in Photoshop. Once I brought the assets into After Effects, I just animated the two halves getting pulled apart with translation keys and had the cheese scale in the x direction. To finish it off, I had the text pop back in.This actually didn’t take that long at all to do so I decided to do another AR thing. 

<p></p>
<span class="image main"><img src="images2/ar2_02.jpeg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  

I looked around for some upcoming movies, unfortunately the Matrix 4 and John Wick 4 posters haven’t been made yet but luckily the new Dune movie was. I decided that it would look pretty cool if I could incorporate some of the book’s elements into the poster and make it visually cool and give some hints to what the movie is like. It was super tedious isolating all these elements in Photoshop as well as filling in the background with whatever witchcraft I knew but it worked out. 
<p></p>
<span class="image main"><img src="images2/ar2_03.jpeg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  

I decided it might be cool to have the characters on the poster fade in with sand particles, so i figured that out with some tutorials on Youtube and some scripting. I also animated some masks to help sell the effect as well as have the names of the actors appear with them. 
<p></p>
<span class="image main"><img src="images2/ar2_04.jpeg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>  

I had the title appear with some 3D animation and lens flare to make it sci-fi looking since this is one of the most well renown sci-fi titles. And lastly I had the sand wurm come out and eat the viewer as a finisher, strangely I feel like it’s kind of hidden in the original poster so maybe my AR idea helps make that element really pop  It was a bunch of layers and work but I think I was happy with the overall outcome.
