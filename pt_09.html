									<h2> Wrapping things up and crawling to the finsih line</h2>

									After the crazy 30ish hour weekend after a month of prototyping I did to get my game up and running, I felt a bit burnt out but there was work to still be done! I'm not the greatest writer but I still try. These last two weeks were dedicated to gathering all the material I picked up this semester and attempting to synthesis a cohesive thesis two chapters. I had to reflect more on myself and what this project really meant to me and what I really wanted to explore. Going back to all the class exersizes and comments I recived I did a little more reasearch on things that I felt might contribute to my paper. Things like the eight aspects of intellegence to improve, virtual reality history, game design machic cirlces, education and more! I felt like going backwards really did work out super well for me, through all this trial and tribulation I found that I really was interested in the topic of self improvement through the flow state and how challenge contributes to it. 
									
									<p></p>
									It was also quite poetic that doing all this programming as an artist was such a difficult task for me since it was outside my wheel house, I just had no idea it would immediately impact my life so suddenly and drastically, finally pushing me over the hump and evolving me from a 3D artist into more of a tech artist. As I finish this paper which is even more like the avatar of all skills! I think for this break and next semester, I will be mostly focusing on advancing my strengths as a 3D artist and add some impressive visuals to my game to really bring this game to the next level. While doing so, I will be player testing and tweaking the gameplay in parallel now that the bones are all laid out. I can now start bulking my brainchild up!
