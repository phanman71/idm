								<h1>Motion Capture Week 2</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								So during the second week of motion capture, we learned how to use Adobe Muse to create a custom avatar and then Mixamo to auto rig it.
								I decided to make a casual looking fella with regular proportions to avoid risking strange skinning issues later on. I originally wanted to make
								a custom character but definitely did not have any time this week to do so. Who knew working a full time job and going to grad school full time 
								would be so time consuming haha. 
								<p></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/dudebro.JPG" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								
								<p></p>
								This was also my first time using motion builder. I wanted to try out a stylized character I've been working on in my free time. I knew this was going
								to be a long shot based on the proportions and stuff but really did not expect these really wacky results! One error I wanted to mention was that I had 
								to rename some of my bones for it to try working.

								<p></p>
								Well after that experiment I went on to use the carnegie melon motion capture on my guy and exported it to UE4 without too much of an isse. I went with 
								a capture named "playground". I then decided to try and place objects to try and imagine what the invisible playground looked like. I could only imagine that 
								it was some sorta playground with a bunch of bars and steps.

								<p></p>
								So far so good, I'm pretty excited to try and get a bunch of motion capture data for some future projects and maybe some for my personal ones too!
