								<h2>Time Capsule #3 The Comic</h2>
		          
                                For this week, I made up a cool little comic that tells a story of my time capsule being discovered 126 years later!
                                <p></p>

                                First thing I did was a rough little script to outline how the story I had in my head would go along.

                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_01.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>
                                
								The next thing I did was sketch out some quick panels that would follow the outline I made. My story was more
								focused on the visuals but my favorite comics are the ones that are much lighter on the text and tell the story a lot through the graphics. 

                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_02.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>
                                I started making an android character eariler this semester and set up a futuristic beach environment in hopes
                                of using it for a motion capture project, but I decided to make a game instead of doing a cinematic. This project
                                actually became a great excuse to go back to working on it. Made a couple changes here and there but actually followed
                                the storyboard closer than usual. 
                                
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_03.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

                                I kitbashed most of the parts from a package of models in Maya but then formed them into the shape of a female character
                                using Zbrush as well as group the parts into sections for each moveable piece. 
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_07.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>
                                
                                I brought it back into Maya and roughly attached the model to a premade skeleton which I used to pose for each of the panels. Even though the storyboard was pretty rough, it still came in handy for this stage. I also assigned some pieces 
                                with different materials for some variation. 
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_08.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

                                Then I brought it into Unreal Engine 4 where my level I modified was setup. From there I placed my character, virtual 
                                time capsule and took renders trying to get a good composition with my virtual camera. 
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/comic_09.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

                                Once all that was done, I did some heavy editing in Photoshop to get some cool AR effects and tried to design some
                                aesthetic panels.
