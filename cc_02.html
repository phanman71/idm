								<h1>Creative Coding Week 2</h1>
<p>
								For my homework this week I had to create a shape and give it some sort of emotion. I decided to go with a cube that was a little bit of an introvert.
                                <p>
                                The main idea was that when you get a little close to it, it'll freak out a little bit, then run away... just like real life! 
                                <p>
                                At first, I had some issues where the hitbox for my shape was too precise causing a lot of unresponsive like issues.
                                <p>
                                To solve that I found a sample in the p5js example sketches called "mouse functions" by p5 (link in comments of code).
                                <p>
                                It used an if statement with four statements that checked to see if the mouse X and Y were within the shapes upper and lower X and Y. 
                                <p>
                                I used some simple code that we learned in the last class to keep the box in bounds and put in some random values to make the box jump to less predictable directions.
                                <p>
                                The next thing I wanted to do was to make the cube turn a shade of red when you got closer, I used some simple math that got the absolute value of the difference 
                                between where the mouse was and the cube and had it change some of the RGB values. 
                                <p>
                                I also tried to practice around and used functions and variables where ever I could so I made some text embedded in some functions as well as 
                                an event where if u hold down the mouse click, the cube's personality does a 180 and becomes introverted and a little spaztastic and green. 
                                <p>
                                The last challenge was that I wanted to have some animation principal implemented, before someone does an action, there's usually a little bit of a wind-up,
                                in this case, the cube is instantly startled before jumping farther away, but to do that I needed some sort of delay before the second movement or it would be all merged into one movement. That's when I got some advice from Professor Scott and learned how to set up a timer. 
                                <p>
