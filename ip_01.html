								<h1>Ideation & Prototyping Week 1</h1>

									The pandemic is probably the most talked about topic these days and is on everyone’s minds. There are a lot of folks wearing face masks out there. So the first idea for a fantasy device my group came up with in class was a smart face mask. The idea mainly came about because of the current pandemic, in this sci-fi setting maybe diseases wouldn’t have been completely eradicated or maybe our current time has set a cultural evolution where it’s fashionable.

								The first requirement would be the original purpose of the mask which is to help prevent the spread of germs from the nostrils and mouth as well as maybe help protect the user from incoming germs. The mask should be lightweight, breathable, and aesthetic. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ip_ss04.png" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
							
								The idea is that when wearing a face mask, you can’t see what expressions people are making with their mouths if it’s a smile or frown. Some people even benefit from reading lips. The space on your face covered by a mask is also a large amount of real estate that could be used for some kind of personal self-expression as well. My group thought of some interesting solutions like a mechanical changing mask, or LEDs screens that would display the images. I suggested and leaned towards a more lightweight solution that might even be implimentable now using current facial tracking software and projectors.

								I brainstormed an idea where the would be some sort of device you could wear on your neck or on a hat that would be a micro camera to track your facial movements under your mask, maybe through inferred for facial tracking data. The device would also house a micro projector that would put an image of your mouth or whatever you like onto your mask. The user would use their smartphone to control what the projector would put up, maybe instead of a realistic depiction of your actual face talking it could put up text like real-life subtitles, or make it look like you have a funny monster mouth. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ip_ss01.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								
								The idea expanded to maybe this could be used on your whole face for higher protection or to even change how your face looks or even use it as a disguise. The future could have some strange fashion trends but with this device, you could have your face look like anything. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ip_ss02.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 500px;"alt="" /></span>
								
								The last iteration of the idea went full-on sci-fi where you could just wear the device like a necklace and have it transform in a way to cover your face and transform as you spoke or expressed emotion. I think this would protect you from more things than just germs!
