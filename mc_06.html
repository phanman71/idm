								<h1>Motion Capture Week 6</h1>
								<center>
								<p></p>
								
								For this week of motion capture, I got a good chance to get a good refesher on blueprints. For some interactivity and to 
								make sure my final idea worked, I found my old senior thesis from 2014 to test on. I came up with an idea during the last 
								class to have some sort of transforming armor. To test this idea, I set up a simple blueprint where when you get close enough, the animation will play.
								My old file was a bit of a mess and a little tricky to clean up and get to import correctly into UE4 but was able to get it in. 
								I've been able to navigate around a little in blueprints but never have really used it seriously before. I think it would be pretty 
								cool to have a game with a custom controller where you would have a robot arm or body and could shoot blasts from your hand as it transformed. 
								I think I'd like to also dive into facial rigging a little to utilize the facial motion capture as well.
