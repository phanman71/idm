								<h1>3D Art & Aesthetics Week 5/6 setting up lighting and camera</h1>

								<p></p>

								<center>
								For the progress on my midterm, the last two weeks I focused on setting up the scene composition and framing the camera shot to figure out what assets to focus on. The focal point I'm planning on is the sandwich I'm planning on finishing to put in the upper left third of the frame. Trying to lead the eyes towards this point, I have a couple of objects that sort of point towards the plate as well as some noise detail in the background as well. I also did some cloth simulations for the little piece of fabric that's under the plate and drink. For the lighting, I've got an early morning kind of setup that I'm planning, I've got a skylight and I'll have to set the color to be more of a warmer color to look more like morning since the sandwich I'm making is a breakfast one. On my to-do list is finishing up the toliet, sandwich, finish up with the materials on everything, finishing up the lighting, then compositing the render passes. Hopefully in the final image really says my prompt of dirty.
