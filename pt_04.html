								<h1>Pre-Thesis Week 4 Taking Flight</h1>

								<p></p>

								<center>

									For this week I spent a lot of time figuring out a way to have the controllers recognize which way they were pointing so that I could get the player to start flying and testing if motion sickness will be an issue. To test which way the controllers were pointing, I set up a script with arguments to change the color of a light based on where you were pointing.

									Trying to remember where being zeroed out looked light and remembering which way yaw, roll, and pitch where, I decided to quickly mock up a 3D scene after jotting down notes by having the engine print the strings while I was in VR. I'm quite fast at 3D so this was actually quicker for me than to sketch it out in a less clear way. 

									<span class="image main"><img src="images3/prethesis_dev04.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

									Just starting out with the right controller, I have the controllers casting the rotation data to my other script. 


									<span class="image main"><img src="images3/prethesis_dev02.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

									Once I had the four coordinate directions figured out, I expanded it to the inbetween directions. Testing it out while moving my arms, I was able to get it working. 

									<span class="image main"><img src="images3/prethesis_dev03.JPG" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 1000px;"alt="" /></span>

									After getting past this part, I then set up a variable to store which way the controller is in currently. Setting up a switch, when a button is pressed while a direction is pointed to, the player will teleport to a specific location opposite of that direction. I haven't tested it out yet but I'd like to set it up so that you get more of a dash effect rather than a teleport. My next plan is to have things fly at the player and see how dodging things in mid air feel.

									I also started looking up scholarly articles that talk about why people play challenging games, enjoy them or even crave them and how they are benificial. Note: make sure to log into nyu libraries to view some of these links for free.
